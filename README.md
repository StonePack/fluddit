# fluddit
An open source Reddit client for Android and iOS using the [Nord theme](https://www.nordtheme.com/).

## Functionality
As it currently stands the app is not complete. However, I make updates everyday with new fixes and functionality. There are pre-release builds available for Android if you wish to test the initial functionality.

The app supports logging in to your account, browsing subreddits, and viewing most types of post content.
